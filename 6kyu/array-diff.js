// Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

// It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.

// arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
// If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

// arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]




// PREP
// P:2 arrays, numbers
// R: return array a while filtering out all values present in array b
// E:It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.

// arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
// If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

// arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3




function array_diff(a, b) {
    //filter the array then return the filtered array
    return a.filter(num => b.indexOf(num) === -1);
